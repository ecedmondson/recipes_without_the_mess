    </h1>
    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>1 medium bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)</li>
    <li>1¼ cups unsweetened coconut flakes</li>
    <li>⅓ cup nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. plus ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>8 oz. dried soba noodles</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp. tahini</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. honey</li>
    <li>2 tsp. toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li>½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>1 lime</li>
</ul>

    <div class="steps">
<ol>
    <li>Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°. Toss kale, coconut, nutritional yeast, ½ tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large bowl to coat. Divide mixture evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets and roast, tossing and rotating baking sheets halfway through, until kale is crisp and coconut is golden brown, 15–20 minutes.</li>
    <li>While kale is roasting, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Shake off any residual water and place noodles in a clean large bowl.</li>
    <li>Combine tahini, soy sauce, honey, 2 tsp. sesame oil, ½ tsp. red pepper flakes, and remaining ½ cup olive oil in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from lime directly into bowl; halve lime and squeeze in juice (about 2 Tbsp.). Whisk dressing until smooth, then pour about half of it over noodles; toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Add half of kale mixture to noodles and toss to incorporate. Drizzle in more dressing as needed, tossing until noodles are creamy; season with salt. Pile remaining kale on top. Drizzle with additional sesame oil and sprinkle with more red pepper flakes.</li>
