    <div class="steps">
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</li>
    <li>Combine the chopped spinach, dill, scallions, ricotta, and feta cheese in a large bowl and using your very clean hands, mix very well. Knead it, crush it and keep mixing until everything is combined well.</li>
    <li>Taste the mixture and add as much salt and pepper as you like.</li>
    <li>Add the beaten eggs and about 1 cup of olive oil and mix well.</li>
    <li>Rub some oil with your hands all over a half sheet baking pan.</li>
    <li>Lay 3 sheets on the bottom of pan and drizzle with a little olive oil.</li>
    <li>​Place 2 sheets half in the pan and half hanging outside of the pan on all four sides of the ​pan. See the ​video above.</li>
    <li>Spread all of the filling inside of the phyllo sheets. All of the sheets that are hanging outside of the pan should go over the filling. See video.</li>
    <li>​Drizzle some olive oil all over the phyllo. Cover half of the pie with 2 sheets of phyllo, tucking them under and repeat the same with the other side of the pie. This is demonstrated in the video tutorial.</li>
    <li>Take the remaining phyllo sheets one at a time and crumble them in rows on top of the pie. Drizzling all the remaining olive oil on top of them. This will create a crisp, light crust.</li>
    <li>​Using a very sharp knife cut the pie into 12 equal slices.</li>
    <li>​Place in oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 350 degrees. Bake for 1 hour. The pie will be crisp and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Allow to rest at room temperature for at least 20 minutes before serving. This will allow the filling to set.</li>
    <li>​Serve!</li>
