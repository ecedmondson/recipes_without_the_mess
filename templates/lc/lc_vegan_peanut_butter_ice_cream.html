    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>



								1 (14-ounce)  can coconut milk (NOT low-fat)
							

</li>
    <li>



								1 large ripe banana, cut into chunks and frozen for at least 4 hours
							

</li>
    <li>



								3 tablespoons peanut butter, smooth or chunky
							

</li>
    <li>



								2 tablespoons cacao powder
							

</li>
    <li>



								 Honey or maple syrup (optional)
							

</li>
</ul>

    <li>

In a food processor, combine the coconut milk and banana and process until smooth, occasionally scraping down the sides.

</li>
    <li>

Add the peanut butter and cacao powder and blend until well mixed. Taste and, if desired, sweeten with honey or maple syrup.

</li>
    <li>

Pour into a freezer-proof container with a lid and place in the freezer until the ice cream mixture is almost set, 2 to 4 hours.

</li>
    <li>

Remove from the freezer and dump the mixture into the processor again and process. Then return it to the container and freeze until set, 1 to 2 hours more. (The extra processing creates a smoother ice cream with fewer ice crystals.)

</li>
    <li>

To serve, simply scoop the ice cream. If itâ€™s become very firm in the freezer, let it rest at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before serving to allow for easy scooping.
