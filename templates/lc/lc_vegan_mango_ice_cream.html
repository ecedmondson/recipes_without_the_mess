<ul>
    <li>



								5 (about 1 lb) very ripe bananas, peeled, sliced, and frozen


</li>
    <li>



								1 1/2 cups (about 8 oz) frozen mango chunks or other frozen fruit such as sliced peaches, or more to taste, pitted cherries, or berries
							

</li>
    <li>



								3/4 cup plant based milk, preferably sweetened, such as almond milk or cashew milk

<ol>
    <li>

Remove the fruit from the freezer and let it thaw for 5 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

Place the partially thawed fruit, bananas, milk, and peppercorns and sweetener, if desired, in a high-speed blender or food processor. (Don’t attempt to use your everyday blender. You’ll burn out the motor.)

</li>
    <li>

Blend the mixture, scraping the sides occasionally, until smooth, about 1 minute.

</li>
    <li>

Scoop out and serve immediately if you like a soft serve consistency or stash in the freezer for a couple hours to let it harden a little. Sigh and enjoy.

</li>
