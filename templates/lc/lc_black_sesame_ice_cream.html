    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>



								6 tablespoons black sesame seeds
							

</li>
    <li>



								1/3 cup light agave syrup
							

</li>
    <li>



								2 (14-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
							

</li>
    <li>



								1/2 cup unrefined sugar or coconut palm sugar
							

</li>
    <li>



								 Pinch sea salt
							

</li>
    <li>



								3 tablespoons cornstarch
							

</li>
</ul>

    <div class="steps">
<ol>
    <li>

Put the black sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat and wait until they begin to pop and release their aroma, 4 to 6 minutes. Use your judgement on the fine line between toasting and burning. The moment they are toasted, dump them from the skillet onto a plate and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

Blitz the cooled black sesame seeds in a coffee grinder or food processor until finely ground, then place them in a bowl and combine them with the agave syrup to form a paste.

</li>
    <li>

Heat 1 can coconut milk, the sugar, and the salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved, about 10 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

In a bowl, slowly whisk the remaining can of coconut milk into the cornstarch until there are no lumps. Add this mixture to the saucepan.  Whisk to combine. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, for 4 to 6 minutes, until the mixture becomes thick. Use a spatula to frequently stir the mixture so the mixture doesn’t scorch or become lumpy. When the mixture has thickened, remove the pan from the heat and transfer the mixture to a large bowl.

</li>
    <li>

Stir the sesame seed paste into the coconut milk mixture until well combined. If you have parchment paper, place a piece directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming and let cool completely to room temperature. Refrigerate until well chilled, 2 to 3 hours. (You can speed this process up by placing the bowl in a large bowl filled halfway with ice water or, for a set-it-and-forget-it approach, simply leave the mixture in the fridge overnight to chill.)

</li>
    <li>

If you have an ice cream maker, churn the black sesame ice cream mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions and serve immediately or transfer to a container and freezer until the desired consistency. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into a wide, flat, preferably metal pan and place it in the freezer. After 40 minutes, use a fork to mix and break down the ice crystals. Repeat this process twice more, at 40-minute intervals. You can blitz it all in a food processor at the final stage to make it really smooth. Return it to the pan and leave in the freezer to set fully.

</li>
    <li>

Remove the black sesame ice cream from the freezer about 15 minutes before serving to give the ice cream a chance to soften. Do not skip this thawing step as it allows the ice cream to melt only slightly, giving it that delightfully chewy texture.
