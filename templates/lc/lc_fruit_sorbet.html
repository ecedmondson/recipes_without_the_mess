    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>



								3 cups fruit juice
							

</li>
    <li>



								2 1/2 cups cold water
							

</li>
    <li>



								1/2 to 1 cup granulated sugar, depending on how sweet your fruit juice is

    <li>

In a saucepan, whisk together the fruit juice, water, and 1/2 cup sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Let cook until the sugar is fully dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, pour the fruit sorbet mixture into a container, and place in the refrigerator to chill completely.

</li>
    <li>

Take a tiny sip of the chilled fruit sorbet mixture and, if a sweeter concoction is desired, add some or all of the remaining sugar and simmer until dissolved. Repeat the cooling process.

</li>
    <li>

If using an ice cream maker, freeze the fruit sorbet mixture according to your ice cream maker’s directions.
If not using an ice cream maker, place the fruit sorbet mixture in a shallow metal baking pan and stash it in the freezer. Once the fruit sorbet is frozen, break it into chunks and purée it in a blender or food processor until creamy.
