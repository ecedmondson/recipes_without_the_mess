    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>



								1 1/2 cups dried hibiscus flowers  (see LC Getting Your Hands on Hibiscus Flowers Note for sources)
							

</li>
    <li>



								6 cups water
							

</li>
    <li>



								3/4 cup granulated sugar
							

</li>
</ul>

    <li>

Dump all the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue cooking until the liquid is reduced by half to about 3 cups, which should take 20 to 40 minutes or so, depending on the size of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. (If the mixture reduced too much to pour easily, add a little hot water.) Taste the hibiscus syrup. If it seems slightly too sweet, add a little cold water, a touch at a time, until the flavor pleases you. Discard the flowers or do like we do and spread them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and dry them in a low oven for little garnishes for cakes or cupcakes or other sweet little somethings to nibble. 

</li>
    <li>

Fill a large bowl halfway with ice water. Place the bowl of hibiscus syrup in the ice water and stir occasionally until room temperature. Cover the hibiscus syrup and refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.

</li>
    <li>

Divide the hibiscus syrup among ice pop molds or wax-lined paper cups and freeze until itâ€™s just beginning to set, about 3 hours. Insert the sticks into the molds or cups. Let the ice pops freeze for at least 3 more hours, then unmold as directed or peel off the paper cups.
