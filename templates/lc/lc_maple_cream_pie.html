    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>



								 Dough for one (9-inch | 23-cm) single pie crust, chilled for at least 2 hours
							

</li>
    <li>



								1 1/4 cups pure maple syrup
							

</li>
    <li>



								6 large egg yolks
							

</li>
    <li>



								1/4 cup cornstarch
							

</li>
    <li>



								2 cups whole milk
							

</li>
    <li>



								1 cup heavy cream
							

</li>
    <li>



								1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
							

</li>
    <li>



								2 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 oz)
							

</li>
    <li>



								1 cup cold heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks
							

</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>

Preheat the oven to 375°F (191°C).

</li>
    <li>

On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 12-inch-diameter (30-cm) round (about 1/8 inch [3 mm] thick). Transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23-cm) standard pie plate.

</li>
    <li>

Trim the excess dough and fold it to make a decorative edge. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze for at least 15 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

Use the tines of a fork to prick the crust along the sides of the pan. Line the frozen pie crust with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill with pie weights.  Bake the crust until the edges are lightly golden and the crust beneath the parchment or foil is dry, about 25 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

Remove the parchment and weights and continue to bake the crust until it is golden brown, about 20 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Set a fine-mesh sieve next to the crust for later.

</li>
    <li>

In a small saucepan over high heat, bring the maple syrup to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Continue to cook the syrup until it has reduced by about half, 30 to 40 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

In a medium saucepan off the heat, whisk the egg yolks with the cornstarch until smooth. Still whisking constantly, slowly add the milk and cream.

</li>
    <li>

Add the salt, butter, and reduced maple syrup. (Don’t worry if the syrup seizes and clumps. It will smooth out in the next step when you heat the custard.)

</li>
    <li>

Cook the milk mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it has thickened and come to a very low boil, about 7 minutes.

</li>
    <li>

Cook the custard for 1 minute more. Pour it through the sieve into the cooled crust and use the back of a spatula to smooth the surface.

</li>
    <li>

Gently press a piece of parchment or waxed paper directly onto the surface of the custard and refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.

</li>
    <li>

To serve, slice the pie and top with whipped cream.
