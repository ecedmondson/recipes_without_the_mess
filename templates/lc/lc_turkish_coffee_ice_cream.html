    <div class="ingredients">
<ul>
    <li>



								2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
							

</li>
    <li>



								2 tablespoons boiling water
							

</li>
    <li>



								10 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds ground
							

</li>
    <li>



								1 1/4 cups heavy cream
							

</li>
    <li>



								3/4 cup canned sweetened condensed milk
							

</li>
</ul>

    <li>

In a small bowl, combine the espresso powder, boiling water, and ground cardamom. Let cool to room temperature.

Using a stand mixer, an immersion blender, or a handheld electric mixer, beat the cream and condensed milk until the mixture is thick and airy, sorta like loosely whipped cream minus the soft peaks, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in the cardamom coffee mixture.

If using an ice cream maker, transfer the mixture to the maker and process according to the manufacturer’s instructions, about 20 minutes. Serve the ice cream immediately if you like a soft-serve consistency or transfer the ice cream to a container, cover, and freeze for at least a few hours if a harder consistency is desired.
If not using an ice cream maker, scrape the ice cream into a container of some sort, cover with plastic wrap or a lid, and freeze until softly firm, sorta like soft-serve consistency, 3 to 5 hours, or very firm, up to 24 hours. It’s that simple. The ice cream really doesn’t need to be churned or even stirred.
